//1. ways to decalre variable
let empName = "Aadarsh";
var empID = 25; // constant unchangable
const empDep = "IT"; 
empLastName = "Lokhande"; // a way to declare but not recommded

// 2. we could print these at at once using console.table
console.table([empName,empID,empDep]);

/* 3. var is older way to declare varibale,
 it does have some issues with block & functional scope
 i.e. it is no longer uses for production */
